\section{AiM}

\paragraph{}
Another company that makes dataloggers to attach to a vehicle is AiM Sports.
AiM makes dataloggers that are specifically intended for motorsport applications as well other products such as dashboards, steering wheels, and ECUs.
One distinction between AiM and AEM is that AEM also makes and sells sensors for use with their logger while AiM sticks to exclusively making the logger unit.
Similarly to AEM, AiM also makes combined dashes and loggers.
