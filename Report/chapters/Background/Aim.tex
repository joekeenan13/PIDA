\section{AiM}

\paragraph{}
Another company that makes dataloggers to attach to a vehicle is AiM Sports.
AiM makes dataloggers that are specifically intended for motorsport applications as well other products such as dashboards, steering wheels, and ECUs.
One distinction between AiM and AEM is that AEM also makes and sells sensors for use with their logger while AiM sticks to exclusively making the logger unit.
Similarly to AEM, AiM also makes combined dashes and loggers.

\subsection{AiM Loggers}

\paragraph{}
AiM develops several loggers with similar specs to the AEM loggers with some additional features.
The MX series and MXM series loggers are comparable to th CD5 and CD7 logger dashes that are sold by AEM.
These loggers also act as dash displays, with the MX series having a nicer display than the MXM series.

\paragraph{}
AiM also develops loggers that do not serve as a dash, only containing the functionality for aggregating and logging data.
