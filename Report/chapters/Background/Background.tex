To make informed decisions about what this DAQ should look like, it is important to investigate what commercial solutions are available and what tools those commercial solutions use.
This can help to inform design choices and what features to add.
It can also be helpful to determine what the shortcomings of different commercial solutions are so that this project does not repeat the same mistakes.
