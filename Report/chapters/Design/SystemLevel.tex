\section{System Level Design}

At a high level, this system is designed to efficiently and reliably aggregate and store controller and instrumentation data from all over our vehcile.
In order to accomplish this, the data collection solution needs to be desgined with the expandability and usability in mind.
One of the challenges of collecting sensor data for analysis is that it often is the case that which sensors are wanted or needed are not known until the system wanting to be tested is designed and implemented.
