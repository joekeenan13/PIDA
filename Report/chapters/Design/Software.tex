\section{Software Design}

\paragraph{}
The majority of the scope of this project was related to the software and firmware design and implementation.
This section details the design of the software, it's implementation, as well as issues encountered and the ways in which they were addressed or what needs to happen to address the issue.

\subsection{High Level Design and Implementation}

\paragraph{}
The software for this DAQ is designed and implemented to be run in a pseudo-parallel manner.
This means that there are several different tasks that are running sequentially, with each task running small chunks or sub-tasks during each cycle.
Each task is then designed as a state machine to segment itself into these smaller sub-tasks.
In order for each of these tasks to communicate with each other, there is one group of data that each task can reference.
Since this is a sequential action still, conflicts will not occur and ther does not need to be any extra protections for accessing the same data or variable at the same time.

\paragraph{}
The DAQ runs four main tasks that are continuously cycled through:
\begin{itemize}
	\item[(1)] Storage
	\item[(2)] Communication
	\item[(3)] Radio Communication
	\item[(4)] Sensors
	\item[(5)] Health Monitoring
\end{itemize}
The storage task is responsible for the actual logging of data.
The communication task is the task responsible for reading data off the CAN bus.
The radio communication task is responsible for medium-long range telemetry.
The sensors task is responsible for the reading of all on-board sensors.
The health monitoring task is responsible for updating any LED indicators for the health of the system.
Together, these five main tasks handle the running of all parts of the system.
As can be seen in \cref{fig:SoftwareTasks}, these tasks all run sequentially before looping back to the start.

\end{figure}

\paragraph{}
Object-oriented programming (OOP) is utilized significantly for this design.
Every task and sensor is a class that have individiual constructors depending on the needs of the task.
Additionally, each task gets its own enum classes to define the various states for each state machine.
There are two parent classes that are utilized by everything.
For different tasks, there is an abstract task class that forces an implementation for a function that runs the task and requires the intercommunication data to be passed in.
For sensors, there is an abstract sensor class that forces an implementation for two functions, an initialization function and an update function.
Additionally, this class implements a read function that returns the current sensor value.

\paragraph{}
Since this project is based on the Arduino platform, several of the basic tasks for interacting with the hardware are handled by the platform.
This includes things such as setting the mode of a pin, reading and writing from data registers, configuring UART, SPI, and SDIO interfaces, and configuring the interrupt vector table.
Even with the configuration of these periphreals being handled by Arduino, they still need to be configured with the proper settings to be used.
Despite all falling under the Arduino umbrella, each platform is maintained independently of each other.
The people maintaining the Arduino platform for Teensy and the people maintaining the Arduino platform for STM do not communicate with each other, and as a result there are some implementation differences that exist between different hardware platforms using Arduino.

\paragraph{}
Additionally, not every family of microcontrollers from STM receives the same support or even the sample supported functions from the Arduino framework.
One specific issue that arose was a versioning issue for STM32duino.
In versions 18.0.0 onwards, the memory sizes of the H7 family of STM microcontrollers was updated incorrectly, causing code to not run and the debugger to be unusable.
This issue was resolved by reverting the version of STM32duino back to 17.6.0.
Other issues that arose that were not issus on the Teensy platform were the signedness of pins on the STM32, multiple timers on the same timer channels, timer registers having different sizes, and the same interrupt being tied to multiple pins.
One of the largest benefits of this change was having access to the debugger.
Without access to a deebugger, many of these issues would not have been solved or would have taken weeks or longer to debug.

\subsection{Storage Task}

\paragraph{}
The first and foremost task that the DAQ runs is the storage task.
This task is responsible for managing the SD interface as well as managing the filesystem.
This includes things like initializing the communication interface with the SD card, setting up the filesystem, and writing data to the SD card.

\paragraph{}
As with all tasks, this was implemented via a state machine.
A diagram for this state machine can be seen in \cref{fig:StorageDiagram}.
This machine consists of seven states, with each state handling a single part of the task.
These state are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Initialize
	\item Wait to Open
	\item Open
	\item Wait to Write
	\item Write
	\item Close
	\item Error
\end{itemize}
In this state machine, there are two types of states.
These are action states and waiting states.
The action states are all capable of entering the error state if their action fails unexpectandtly.
The waiting states are incapable of entering the error state, since their sole purpose is to wait for certain conditions needed for their corresponding action state.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth]{SDStateMachine.png}
	\caption{Storage State Diagram}
	\label{fig:StorageDiagram}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{}
The Initialize state is responsible for creating the SD instance.
This includes configuring the SDIO communication interface that physically connects the SD card to the microcontroller as well as mounting the FatFS filesystem that is used by the SD card.
The creation of the SD and File objects relies on STM32SD library.
This library provides the functions for initializing the SD interface and for mounting the filesystem.
One major issue is present in this library that needed to be fixed.
The library expects the FatFS implementation to have a function f\_unmount, which can be used to unmount the filesystem.
This function is not present in the FatFS implementation provided by STM32duino.
To resolve this issue, the function call can be replaced with a f\_mount function call with the approriate arguments, or a wrapper function f\_unmount can be created that calls f\_mount with the approriate arguments.
The former was used in this project.
If the returns of both the SD initialization and the FatFS initialization are success codes, the next state is Wait to Open.
If any other codes are returned, the next state is the Error state.
This is outlined in the decision tree in INSERT FIGURE.

\paragraph{}
The wait to Open state is a waiting state that holds the storage task until the logging flag is high.
If the logging flag goes high, the next state is Open.
The task can be held in this state indefinately if the logging flag stays low.
This can occur if the logging switch on the dashboard is disabled or removed.

\paragraph{}
The Open state is responsible for the creation of files.
Once the task enters this state, it searches for the next available file name and attempts to create the file.
The file is created and opened properly if the return of the open function, which is a wrapper around the FatFS f\_open function, returns a non-null value.
This state will attempt to open a file three times before deciding it is unable to.
This is outlined in INSERT FIGURE.
If the file is opened properly, the next state is the Wait to Write state.
If the state is unable to open a file, the next state is the Error state.

\paragraph{}
The Wait to Write state is another waiting state that holds the storage task until new data is received.
Once a new piece of data is received from the CAN bus or from reading the onboard sensors, this state transitions to the Write state.
If there are no nodes on the CAN network or a CAN error and all the onboard sensors are disabled, the storage task can be held indefinately in this state.

\paragraph{}
The Write state is responsible for actually writing the most recent data to the SD card.
