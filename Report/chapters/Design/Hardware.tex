\section{Hardware Design}

\paragraph{}
The hardware design, with the exception of component selection, was largely outside the scope of this project and was completed by other members of the competition team.
As the most senior member of the electronics team and the Electrical Technical Director, though, part of my responibilities to the project included design reviews and feedback on schematic design, layout, and routing.

\paragraph{}
As with any embedded systems project, the code for the project does depend on the hardware design
